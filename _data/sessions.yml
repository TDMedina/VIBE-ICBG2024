#   title: "Cancer Evolution and Metastasis "
#   description: "Cancer development within an individual is an evolutionary process. This has important clinical implications for cancer prevention and therapy, as well as our understanding of cancer progression and metastatic spread. In this talk, I will outline how we can exploit cancer genomic sequencing data to decipher cancer evolutionary histories and the extent of diversity within individual tumours. I will focus on lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. I will evaluate how tumours spread from the primary tumour to distant sites, and when this occurs during a tumour’s development. Finally, I will explore how we can use novel bioinformatics tools to shed light on the interface between the cancer cell and the immune microenvironment, and mechanisms of immune escape. I will explore how DNA sequencing data can be harnessed to identify T cells in tumour samples, and the clinical relevance of T cell infiltrate in predicting response to immunotherapy.  "

#   title: "Jacopo Umberto Verga:<br>Multiple myeloma, single cell-level characterisation of natural killer cells show exhaustion from early stages of disease progression"
#   description: "Multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are blood cancers associated with high relapse rates. These ancer cells reside in the bone marrow (BM). As the disease evolves, it alters the microenvironment of the BM, which will eventually support the growth of malignant cells. To evade detection, cancer cells repress the immune response by activating the immune checkpoint receptors. Drugs targeting immune checkpoints have shown promise in tumor eradication, but a thorough understanding of how immune cells are affected in the microenvironment is needed to develop efficient therapies capable of reactivating immune recognition of the tumor. A scRNA-Seq approach across multiple studies would provide a high-resolution perspective of the various stages of the disease. The inclusion of more studies would allow us to draw a broad panorama of the BM microenvironment and to isolate specific cell subtypes. Finally, by focusing on the interaction of immune and cancer cells along with the progression of the disease, and by tracing the differentiation trajectories, we aim to identify new therapeutic candidates against these conditions. To this end, we developed a pipeline to process and integrate scRNA-Seq data from different studies that retrieve raw data, compute counts, filter empty/double droplets and perform quality control (Seurat). Afterward, cell subtypes are assigned using the package singleR and the reference dataset from Granja et al 2019. For MM we collected 42 samples from 4 publicly available studies obtaining a whole dataset consisting of >190,000 cells comprising all disease stages. After sorting the cells by the disease stages, we already tracked the cell types proportions present in each. The next steps will include differential gene expression analysis of the immune and cancer cells alongside the disease stages, differentiation trajectory inference and cell-cell interaction analysis to highlight events that drive the disease progression/relapse."

#   title: "Elle Loughran:<br>Attenuation of Copy Number Alterations in Cancer"
#   description: "Cancer karyotypes are characterised by widespread copy number alterations and aneuploidy, which can cause stoichiometric imbalances between members of protein complexes. In the germline, stoichiometric imbalances affecting dosage-sensitive genes produce deleterious effects that restrict copy number variation and contribute to the lethality of nearly all germline aneuploidies. It is unclear how tumours tolerate such high levels of aneuploidy. Recent work suggests that tumours face pressure to maintain stoichiometric balance at the protein level and that the ability to buffer CNAs via dosage compensation is associated with higher tumour fitness (Senger et al, 2022). We sought to understand the extent to which CNAs are buffered in cancer by integrating copy number, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data from the CPTAC and CCLE databases. Using copy number-RNA-protein correlations, we derive a CNA attenuation score for each gene and investigate how CNA length and overall genomic ploidy affect dosage compensation. Aneuploidy is a known prognostic factor in cancer (Van Dijk et al, 2021), but we hypothesise that the effects of aneuploidy depend on the level of dosage compensation of the altered genes. We will use our gene-specific CNA attenuation scores to predict ‘effective aneuploidy’ for each patient tumour in The Cancer Genome Atlas and investigate whether effective aneuploidy is a better predictor of prognosis than aneuploidy alone."

#   title: "Sunandini Ramnarayanan:<br>Can mutations in the non-protein-coding “Dark Matter” of our genome drive tumorigenesis? Insights from 16,000 Genomics England tumours"
#   description: "The majority of somatic tumour mutations fall in DNA that does not encode proteins, yet it remains unknown if these non-coding mutations can act as “drivers” that promote cell fitness. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are amongst the most highly mutated non-coding regions and have been widely linked to cancer. We previously developed ExInAtor, a software package that identifies driver genes via signatures of positive selection in somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Here, we leveraged the unique collection of 16,000 tumour genomes from Genomics England to search for driver lncRNAs. Our analysis reveals evidence for 60 significantly mutated lncRNAs across 11 tumours (FDR<0.0001), a significant increase over previous collections. The resulting catalogues are significantly enriched for lncRNAs with known roles in cancer, such as NEAT1 and MALAT1. Putative driver lncRNAs are significantly associated with a range of clinical and genomic features that further support their disease relevance. Follow-up studies will employ genome-editing approaches to experimentally test the fitness effects of SNVs. These findings will provide an essential foundation for understanding the role of cancer-driver lncRNAs, and these non-coding mutation maps derived from Genomics England may offer novel strategies for personalised therapy."

#   title: "John Scanlan:<br>A multi-omic approach to understand the effects of weight loss on immune cell function"
#   description: "Obesity is recognised as one of the primary causes of ill health globally as it contributes to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and is associated with 49% of cancers. High energy western diets, inactivity associated with modern day society, and genetic susceptibility are all contributing factors leading to the obesity pandemic. Several studies have shown the profound impact immune cells play in the pathogenesis of obesity as evidenced by immune cell dysfunction in tissues such as the liver and adipose. As well as causing chronic low-grade inflammation, obesity also negatively effects vaccine efficacy and leads to increased risk of complications from infection. Thus, effective therapeutic interventions for obesity and its associated co-morbidities are highly sought-after. Weight loss is one such established therapeutic intervention for dealing with obesity and its complications. Modest weight loss (~10%) improves glycaemic control, reduces blood pressure, and reduces cholesterol levels, however, it remains unclear if weight loss restores immune cell function which is dysregulated in obesity. To analyse if immune cell function is recovered following weight loss we used a combination of scRNA-seq and metabolomics to analyse tissues obtained from a weight loss mouse model. Initial exploratory analysis reveals several key genes and metabolites changed following weight loss providing insights into the mechanisms underlying immune cell dysfunction in obesity. We also analysed a human weight loss scRNA-seq cohort allowing for findings in the mouse model to be cross-checked in humans for similar changes. Collectively, these analyses may provide insights into key mechanisms of immune cell dysfunction in obesity and potential methods of therapeutically targeting such mechanisms to improve immune cell health in this cohort."

#   title: "Isabelle Boothman:<br>Testing for common pharmacogenomic predictors of vigabatrin-associated visual field loss, under univariate & polygenic models."
#   description: "The anti-seizure drug vigabatrin (VGB) is an effective drug for controlling seizures, especially infantile spasms. However, use is limited by VGB-associated visual field loss (VAVFL). Approximately 33% of VGB-exposed adult patients experience this adverse reaction (Maguire, 2010) although the mechanisms by which VGB causes VAVFL remains unknown. Average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (ppRNFL) thickness is correlated with the degree of visual field loss (measured by mean radial degrees (Clayton, Dévilé et al. 2011). Duration of VGB exposure, maximum daily VGB dose, & male sex are associated with peripapillary retinal nerve fiber thinning. We hypothesize that common genetic variation is a predictor of VAVFL. Identifying pharmacogenomic predictors of VAVFL could potentially enable safe prescribing of VGB and broader use of a highly effective drug. Methods: Optical coherence topography (OCT) data were produced on VGB-exposed individuals (n=99) from the EpiPGX consortium. We conducted quantitative GWAS analyses for the following OCT thickness measurements: 1) Average ppRNFL, 2) inferior quadrant, 3) nasal quadrant, 4) superior quadrant, 5) temporal quadrant, 6) inferior nasal sector, 7) nasal inferior sector, 8) superior nasal sector, 9) nasal superior sector. We included sex, cumulative dose, maximum daily dose, duration of prescription of VGB (years) and 4 principal components as covariates. Using the summary statistics from the GWAS analyses we conducted gene-based testing using VEGAS2. To determine if VGB exposed patients were predisposed to having a thinner RNFL, we calculated their polygenic burden for retinal thickness. We conducted nine different PRS analyses using the OCT measurements. PRS alleles for retinal thickness were calculated using the summary statistics from a large-scale GWAS of inner retinal morphology using the OCT images of 31,434 UK Biobank participants (Currant, Hysi et al. 2021). Results: The GWAS analyses did not identify a significant association after correction for multiple testing. Similarly, the gene-based and PRS analyses did not reveal a significant association that survived multiple testing. Conclusion: We set out to identify common genetic predictors for VGB-induced ppRNFL thinning (as a marker of VAVFL), under univariate & polygenic models. Results suggest that large-effect common genetic predictors are unlikely to exist for VGB-induced VAVFL. Sample size was a limitation of this study, power calculations show we were underpowered in this study. However, recruitment is a challenge as VGB is rarely used today because of this adverse reaction. Rare variants may be predictors of this ADR and were not studied here."

#   title: "Kane Collins:<br>Polygenic burden for stroke related traits in deceased kidney donors"
#   description: "Intracranial Haemorrhage (ICH) and stroke are common causes of death among kidney donors, but the underlying genetic factors involved are poorly understood. Both ICH and stroke are highly heritable and polygenic. Polygenic burden for a trait can be calculated by generating a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) which estimates the cumulative effect of common genetic variation on an individual’s disease status. Previous studies have found that PRSs for ischemic stroke offer predictive performance similar to clinical risk factors. Here we investigate the role of polygenic burden in determining donor cause of death and age of death as well as it’s impact on recipient graft function. Methods: We utilised 5,292 genotyped kidney transplant donor-recipient pairs from 4 different centres from across Europe. We calculated PRSs for stroke, Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) and hypertension using large published GWASs of European ancestry. We compared PRSs between the donors who died of stroke (2,642 individuals) and controls, as well as donors who died of other causes and living donors. We investigated whether donor polygenic risk impacted on donor age and on graft survival and function. Results: Donors who died of stroke had significantly higher mean PRSs for hypertension, stroke, and IA than controls (p-values 3e-15, 4e-9, and 0.001 respectively). Hypertension PRS had a significant effect on donor age of death among the donors who died of other causes. (Beta: 1.4, p: 2e-4). We also found significant effects of PRSs for hypertension and IA on graft survival as well as eGFR at 1 and 5 years post-transplant. Conclusion: These observations support the hypothesis that deceased donors carry an increased burden for traits related to stroke. Increased burden for these traits results in a greater risk of death from stroke as well as a younger age of death. These PRSs are similarly predictive to well established clinical risk factors including hypertension, current smoking and male sex. Kidneys that come from donors with high polygenic risk for all traits have a significantly worse graft function and survival from low risk kidneys. PRSs can distinguish donors from the general population. These findings could have utility in testing relatives of donors to determine if they share the same risk for stroke."

#   title: "Our complicated relationship with microbes and how genomics can help"
#   description: "The vast majority of microbes are harmless to us, and many play essential roles in health. Others are pathogens and exert a spectrum of deleterious effects on their hosts. Infectious diseases have historically represented the most common cause of death in humans (until recently) exceeding by far the toll taken by wars or famines. From the dawn of humanity and throughout history, infectious diseases have shaped human evolution, demography, migrations and history. In this talk, I will discuss some aspects of our long-standing relationship with microbial pathogens and how genomics can unravel that complicated history. I will talk about how genomics can be applied to the past, present and future. The past will focus on the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica and genomes recovered from long since deceased hosts. For the present, I will talk about Salmonella enterica ser. Agona from European badgers. For the future, I will reflect on our experience of tracking the culprit of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, and the steps required to combat future pandemics. "

#   description: "Lager brewing first occurred in Bavaria in the 15th century, associated with restrictions of brewing to colder months. The lager yeast, Saccharomyces pastorianus, is cold tolerant. It is a hybrid between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus, and has been found only in industrial settings. Natural isolates of S. eubayanus were first discovered in Patagonia 11 years ago. They have since been isolated from China, Tibet, New Zealand and North America, but not fromEurope. Here, we describe the first European strains UCD646 and UCD650, isolated from a wooded area on a university campus in Dublin, Ireland. We generated complete chromosome level assemblies of both genomes using long and short read sequencing. The UCD isolates belong to the Holarctic clade. Genome analysis shows that isolates similar to the Irish strains contributed to the S. eubayanus component of the S. pastorianus isolates, but isolates from Tibet share more similarities."

#   description: "The development of ancient genomic techniques has allowed the exploration of both host genomes and the genomes of commensal and pathogenic microbes. Teeth provide a particularly rich substrate: as well as endogenous host DNA, they are also a source of DNA from both bloodborne pathogens and the oral microbiota. We carried out metagenomic screening of a dataset of 344 tooth and calculus samples from diverse prehistoric and Medieval contexts. This identified two Early Bronze Age teeth, samples from a limestone cave at Killuragh, Co. Limerick, which had exceptional preservation of oral pathobiont species. De novo genome assembly could be carried out for two species, Streptococcus mutans and Treponema denticola. S. mutans is a key causative agent of dental caries, due to its ability to metabolise carbohydrates, form biofilms and survive acidic environments. The Killuragh genome is the first reported ancient S. mutans genome: here we present our new genome and preliminary analysis of phylogenetic placement and virulence factors. Our results show this 4,000 year old genome is nested within modern S. mutans diversity, demonstrating the ancient association between host and pathogen. Furthermore, while 93.7% of modern genomes harbour at least one mutacin, proteins important for the colonisation and establishment of S. mutans in the dental biofilm, the Killuragh genome is negative for all tested mutacins."

#   description: "The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles laid a foundation for sharing and publishing scientific data, now extending to all digital objects including software with the recent publishing of the FAIR principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS).  One kind of software widely used in Biosciences is computational workflow systems – whose adoption has accelerated in the past few years driven by the need for repetitive and scalable data processing, access to and exchange of processing know-how, and the desire for more reproducible (or at least transparent) and quality assured processing methods. Over 320 workflow systems are currently available, although a much smaller number are widely adopted.  As first class, publishable research objects, it seems natural to apply FAIR principles to workflows.  But what does the FAIRness of workflows mean and why does it matter? ELIXIR, European Research Infrastructure for Life Science Data, the European EOSC-Life Workflow Collaboratory, Australia BioCommons and the Workflow Community Initiative, alongside big workflow players like Galaxy, snakemake and Nextflow, are developing an ecosystem of tools, guidelines and best practices to make bioscience workflows FAIR.  In this talk I will shine a light on this work, ranging from the bigger picture of strategic directions to the practicality of daily work in the lab."

#   title: "Anna Grossbach:<br>Modelling Epigenetic Age Over Time"
#   description: "Epigenetic clocks are statistical models that estimate aging using DNA methylation data from selected CpG sites across the genome. These estimates, known as epigenetic age, are strongly correlated with chronological age, but departures from these predictions, known as epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), are associated with various exposures or health outcomes. Most studies of epigenetic age are cross-sectional with a single epigenetic age measurement. However, the recent growth in cohorts with longitudinal DNA methylation data has increased the number of research studies on epigenetic age over time. In this study, we explore methods for modelling epigenetic age over time using a review of the literature and simulation study of commonly used approaches. A review of the latest literature discovered major discrepancies in methods to model longitudinal epigenetic age data. Methods differed in their (i) outcome (e.g., EAA or epigenetic age), (ii) time variable (e.g., chronological age or categorical time at measurement), and (iii) statistical model to capture change over time. While most studies used epigenetic age as the longitudinal outcome of interest, others include EAA instead. We identified two equally common ways to account for time in a model – either to include chronological age or categorical time. We identified three frequently used methods to measure change over time: (a) linear mixed effect models (LMM), (b) delta aging, which quantifies the difference between follow-up and baseline measurements, and (c) generalized estimating equations (GEE). The most common approach was to use LMM with a random intercept term, but rarely a random slope term, to account for repeated measurements. Using a simulation study, we tested the robustness of approaches for selecting the outcome, time variable, and statistical model in estimating the effect of an exposure X on longitudinal epigenetic aging. Modelling either epigenetic age or EAA as the outcome of an LMM, including both a random intercept and slope term, gave unbiased estimates for the effect of an exposure on epigenetic aging. Chronological age was a more robust time variable than categorical time at measurement. GEE and LMM without a random slope term led to similar accuracy, while the delta aging approach resulted in large bias when estimating the effect of an exposure on epigenetic aging. In summary, these results provide guidance for future studies evaluating associations between exposures and longitudinal epigenetic age. Ultimately, more consistent methods in epigenetic aging studies will improve the robustness and reproducibility of findings."

#   title: "Swathi Ramachandra Upadhya:<br>Variable reliability of protein abundance measurements influences observed mRNA-protein correlations in tumours."
#   description: "mRNA and protein abundances correlate only moderately. It is unclear to what extent this moderate correlation reflects post-transcriptional regulation and to what extent it reflects measurement error. Here, by analysing replicate proteomic profiles of tumours and cell lines, we show that there is considerable variation in the reproducibility of proteins measured using mass spectrometry (MS). Proteins with more reproducible MS measurements tend to have a higher mRNA-protein correlation. The reproducibility of individual proteins is somewhat consistent across studies, and we exploit this to develop an aggregate reproducibility score that explains a substantial amount of the variation in mRNA-protein correlations across multiple studies. A complementary approach to MS based proteomics is to measure proteins using Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) wherein hundreds of proteins are measured using antibodies. However, we find that the variable quality of antibodies in these arrays has a significant influence on the observed mRNA-protein correlations. Overall, these results suggest that reliability of protein abundance measurements accounts for a substantial fraction of the unexplained variation between mRNA and protein abundances."

#   description: "The ability to measure gene expression levels for individual cells (vs. pools of cells) is crucial to address many important biological questions, such as the study of stem cell differentiation, the detection of rare mutations in cancer, or the discovery of cellular subtypes in the brain. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows the high-throughput measurement of gene expression levels for entire genomes at the resolution of single cells. RNA-Seq studies provide a great example of the range of questions one encounters in a Data Science workflow, where the data are complex in a variety of ways, there are multiple analysis steps, and drawing on rigorous statistical principles and methods is essential to derive reliable and interpretable biological results. In this talk, I will provide a survey of statistical questions related to the analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data to investigate the differentiation of stem cells in the brain, including, exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, normalization, expression quantitation, cluster analysis, and the inference of cellular lineages."
