  bio: >
    Throughout my career, I have developed innovative computational and
    experimental approaches to advance our understanding of centromeric and
    pericentromeric DNAs. I work at the forefront of genome technologies as
    part of the T2T and Pangenome initiative to construct genetic and
    epigenetic maps to expand our understanding of their structure and
    function.  As a group leader, I prioritize fostering a creative and
    scientifically rigorous environment that supports inclusivity and
    diversity within our scientific team.  I also prioritize training that
    operates at the intersection of science, justice, and equity.
